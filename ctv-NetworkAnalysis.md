This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages that can be used for dealing with networks (also known as _relational data_ and _graphs_).

This list of R packages is curated to include tools specifically designed for analysing and modeling relational data. These packages facilitate the examination of phenomena - be they natural, social, or otherwise artificial - that manifest themselves in the relations between one or more sets of entitiess.
Conversely, the list excludes packages that primarily deal with graphical models defined as graph representions of conditional in/dependence between variables. This includes Markovian graphs, which, despite their relevance in statistical modeling, are better covered under the CRAN TaskView on [Graphical Models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/GraphicalModels.html). This distinction keeps the list focused on network analysis that goes beyond mere statistical dependencies, aiming instead to explore broader relational dynamics.

This page is articulated in sections listing the packages/functions to perform specific operations on networks. The packages are categorised based on their scope and focus as follows:

1. The first section provides a review of all-in-one R packages for basic network-analytic operations such as creating, manipulating, and describing relational data.

2. Subsequently, packages offering models and inference tools applicable across disciplines and fields of interests are discussed. Here, a distinction is drawn between frequentist and Bayesian methods. 

2. Then, the focus shifts to packages containing data structures, methods, and model with a narrower field of application. The list includes some of the areas where network methods are more widely applied: ecology, bibliometrics, (bio)-chemistry, neurosciences and psychology, public health, the social sciences and economics.

4. Finally, packages and functions for two advanced network-analytic tasks are presented: visualisation and clustering. In the latter case, the items listed are distinguished on the basis of their approach into three categories:

    - community detection,
    - blockmodeling;
    - others.

Some packages could be placed under more heading because they can perform multiple tasks (e.g., clustering and visualisation). But for the sake of brevity, non-core packages are listed only once: in the section that described each package's main use case.

If you think that some package is missing from the list, please file an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the maintainer.

# Main Packages & Basic tasks

- `r pkg("igraph", priority = "core")` provides tools for creating, manipulating, and analysing network structures with a focus on _nice_ graphical representations and fast algorithms to operate on large datasets (particularly manipulating data and dealing with vertex attributes).

  - *Approach*: igraph takes a somewhat 'basic' approach to network analysis. However, it still contains a lot of functionality, including
calculating network properties, generating random graphs for simulations, etc. and will probably fit most users' needs.

  - *Flexibility*: any of the functions  are provided in two versions: for direct assignment and a 'piped' version $\big($e.g., `igraph::E(net)$attribute <- x` vs `net <- igraph::set_edge_attr(net, 'attribute', value = x)`$\big)$.
  
  - *Support*: There are tons of online resources answering virtually any question concerning _how_ to do anything in `igraph` thanks to a large  community and active maintainers.
  
  - *Extensions*: There are a number of add-on packages that integrate igraph with `Shiny`, `r pkg("ggplot2")` and other drawing tools, or provide sample datasets. According to the latest review,^[see: Kanevsky, Gregory. 2016. 'R Graph Objects: igraph vs. network. _R Bloggers_. January 30, 2016.  https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/01/r-graph-objects-igraph-vs-network/] `igraph` has many more extension that the closest runner-up, `network`/`statnet`.

- `r pkg("statnet", priority = "core")`  is a collection of packages (incl. `r pkg("network, priority = "core"`) developed by the _statnet_ team at the
University of Washington.

  - *Approach*: It is not always user-friendly because its focus is on statistically testing models based on  Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and other modeling tools;
 
  - *Flexibility*: New users may find it useful to install only the two basic packages in `statnet`: `nework` and `sna`. Note that, as `igraph`, also these packages suit both traditional coding and a 'piped' approach; 
 
  - *Comprehensiveness*: `statnet`'s (and `network`'s/`sna`'s) biggest advantage is that it allows users to carry out most network-analytical operations, especially in dealing with social network analysis (SNA). But the trade-off, of course, is that the amount of possibilities makes life harder for new users.

- `r pkg("graph")` is a package available on [Biocondutor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/graph.html) designed for handling graph-based data structures and performing basic operations on them. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for constructing, manipulating, and analysing graphs.^[Since this Task View focuses on `R` packages available on CRAN, `graph` is not covered as extensively as its main competitors.]

  - *Simplicity*: `graph` focuses on providing fundamental functionalities for graph-based tasks, such as graph construction, visualization, and basic analysis. So, it does not offer the same level of statistical modeling capabilities as `statnet` and is less geared towards large networks than `igraph`.
  
  - *Documentation*: `graph` benefits from a clear and concise documentation, making it accessible to users of all levels. Additionally, it offers straightforward tutorials and examples to help users get started with graph analysis in R.
  
  - *Extentions*: `graph` can be expanded with other packages containing efficient algorithms (for tasks such as shortest path, connectivity etc) and different layout algorithms.

- `r pkg("intergraph, priority = "core")` is not a network analysis package _per se_. Rather it allows to easily convert objects produced by `statnet` packages into `igraph`s (or a data frame) and vice versa. Thus, it is a must-have utility for leveraging multiple packages' functionalities and ensuring compatibility between several users' workflows.

## Network Construction

Altough the two core packages for network analysis in `R` can create a wide range of networks from different types of inputs, there are also specialsied packages for narrower fields of application.

  - `r pkg("BoolNet")` provides tools for assembling, analysing and visualising synchronous and asynchronous (probabilistic) Boolean networks as well as  Boolean networks. All the main functions are described in a handy [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BoolNet/vignettes/BoolNet_package_vignette.pdf).
  
  - `r pkg("egor")` allows to create ego-centric networ starting on exports from [_EgoNet_](https://github.com/egonet/egonet), [_EgoWeb 2.0_](https://www.qualintitative.com/egoweb/) and [_openeddi_](https://github.com/jfaganUK/openeddi). It includes a Shiny app and procedures for creating and visualising clustered graphs.
  
  - `r pkg("ionet")` creates network starting bt turning input-output tables into weighted adjacency matrices.
 
----

Note: While `igraph` does not have a specific structure for dynamic networks, `statnet` can manage them through `r pkg("networkDynamic")` and analyse them with `r pkg("tsna")`.

----

## Network Manipulation

Both main packages for network analysis provide similar network-manipulation capabilities, but other packages also offer a more limited set of options.

- `r pkg("tidygraph")` is designed for handling and manipulating graph data within the [_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework. It provides a tidy approach to working with relational data, allowing users to apply familiar data manipulation techniques from the tidyverse to graphs. It does not make it into the 'core' packages because it lacks a comprehensive set of tools for network analysis. Users can easily perform tasks such as filtering, summarizing, and joining graph data using familiar tidyverse syntax. Given that both `r pkg ("igraph")` and `r pkg ("statnet")`/`r pkg ("network")` provide piped functions for most operations, ``r pkg ("tidygraph")`'s added value lies mainly in the possibility of accessing directly either the node data, the edge data or the graph itself while computing inside verbs.

## Network Analysis

Both `r pkg ("igraph")` and `r pkg ("statnet")` offer functions for a similar set of network-analytic operations, whereas `r pkg ("tidygraph")` is much more limited. Amongst them, it may be worth mentioning some algorithms that differ at least slightly in the implementation and/or there are noteworthy specialised packages.

### Centrality

Both main packages can compute betweenness, eigenvalue, power, and closeness centrality, but `r pkg ("igraph")` offers more options than `r pkg ("sna")` and `r pkg ("tidygraph")` overall. In addition:

- `r pkg("centiserve")` adds dozen of centrality measures for `r pkg ("igraph")` objects such as bottleneck, decay, and entropy centrality.

- `r pkg("birankr")` provides optimised functions for estimating various centrality measures in bipartite/two-mode networks.It can also estiamte efficiently page-rank in one-mode networks, project two-mode networks to one-mode ones, and convert edge lists and matrices to the `sparseMatrix` format offered in the package `Matrix`. It supports edge lists (in the `data.frame`, `data.table::data.table`, or `tidydata::tbl_df` class) and adjacency matrices (either in the built-in `matrix` class or in `Matrix`'s `dgCMatrix` class).

# Network Modeling & Simulation

Notably, the underlying data mining approach has been used beyond biochemistry. There are several packages on Bioconductor that reverse-depend/extend these functionalities.

  - `r pkg("c3net")` allows to infer gene-regulation networks with direct physical interactions using `C3NET` (Altay and Emmert-Streib [2010](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-4-132)). Other packages implement improvements/variants of this algorithm based on the literature, such as:
  
    - `r pkg("Ac3net")` Infers directional conservative causal core in gene network based on the algorithm for directional network proposed by Altay ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1101/271031)).
    
    - `r pkg("bc3net")` implements the BC3NET algorithm for inference on gene-regulation networks  (Simoes and Emmert-Streib [2012](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033624)). In essence it offers a Bayesian approach with noninformative prior to the C3NET algorithm.

  - `r pkg ("EpiModel")` builds on Statnet's for epidemic modelling. But more on this field of application can be found in the [CTV: Epidemiology](https://cran.r-project.org/view=Epidemiology).

## Social and Economic networks

- `r pkg ("sna")` implements many operations commonly carried out on networks in the social and econonomic sciences with the ability of regress a network variable on others using ordinary least square, linear network autocorrelation models or a logistic regression.^[More on this type of applications can be found in the CRAN TaskView on [Graphical Models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/GraphicalModels.html)]
 
- `r pkg("FinNet")` provides classes, methods, and functions to deal with financial networks involving both physical and legal persons. The package assists in creating various types of financial networks: ownership, board interlocks, etc..

The package  allows users to create visually appealing and interactive network visualizations with features such as zooming, panning, and node highlighting. The package offers a user-friendly interface for creating interactive network visualisations, making it suitable for un-experienced users.

- `r pkg("networkD3")` provides functions that turns edge lists into a D3 JavaScript network, tree, dendrogram, or Sankey graphs.

  - `r pkg("bipartiteD3")` uses the `D3` and `viz-js` libraries for plotting networks produced with the `r pkg("bipartite")` package.
  
- `r pkg("diagram")` was born as a companion to the book _A practical guide to ecological modelling_ by K. Soetaert and P.M.J. Herman. But it can visualise any network given in the form of a transition matrix as a flow diagram, a web or grid. 

- `r pkg("ndtv")` renders network objects from the package `networkDynamic` as videos or interactive animations.

- `r pkg("neatmaps")` tries to simplify the exploratory step of data analysis by providing function to easily produce hierarchical clusterings (`neatmaps::hierarchy`), consensus clusterings (`neatmaps::consClustResTable`) and heatmaps of multiple networks (`neatmaps::neatmap`).

# Clustering

## Community detection

- `r pkg("cencrne")` proposes a regularised network-embedding model to simultaneously estimate the community structure and the number of communities in an asymptotically consistent way. Them method is mainly used in biosciences, but is applicable across the board.

- `r pkg("linkcomm")` provides functions for generating, visualising, and analysing overlapping communities in networks of arbitrary size and type. Unlike `igraph` and `network`, it can compute relatedness `linkcomm::getClusterRelatedness` and `linkcomm::getCommunityConnectedness` as well as generate a mesoscopic matrix (`linkcomm::getCommunityMatrix`). Moreover, it can produce membership for hierarchical communities (`linkcomm::getNestedHierarchies`).

## Blockmodeling

### Generalised blockmodeling (structural and/or regular equivalence)

- `r pkg("sna")` implements a simple version of stuctural-equivalence blockmodel (`sna::blockmodel`), can generate networks with a given blockmodel as well as print and plot the results.

- `r pkg("concoR")` implements the classical CONCOR (CONvergence of iterated CORrelation) algorithm (Breiger, Boorman, and Arabie [1975](https://doi.org/10.1016%2F0022-2496%2875%2990028-0)) for one- and multi-mode un/directed networks.

- `r pkg("blockmodeling")`: this package offers and implementation of generalised blockmodeling (`blockmodeling::optRandomParC`) as well as functions for computation of (dis)similarities in terms of structural or regular equivalence and plotting. Furthermore, it include implementations of the REGE (also implemented in Ucinet) algorithm (`blockmodeling::REGE`).
  - `r pkg("BlockmodelingGUI")` is a Shiny app providing a graphical interface for generalised blockmodeling of single-relation, one-mode networks from the package `r pkg("blockmodeling")`. It includes several ways to visualise networks and partitions.

- `r pkg("kmBlock")` implements a k-means like approach to the blockmodeling of one-mode and linked networks as presented in Žiberna ([2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.006)) based on structural equivalence.

- `r pkg("signnet")` offers to functions implementing the generalised blockmodeling with structural equivalence (`signnet::signed_blockmodel`) and generalised equivalence (`signnet::signed_blockmodel_general`) of signed networks based on `graph` objects from the R package `r pkg("igraph")` 

### Stochastic blockmodeling (SBM)

- `igraph` cannot run SBMs, but it can generates a random graph according to a specified SBM (`igraph::sample_sbm`) or an arbitrary hierarhical SBM (`igraph::sample_hierarchical_sbm`)

- `r pkg("blockmodels")` allows to run the SBM or the Latent Block Model (LBM) of static networks using  a Variational Expectation Maximisation algorithm. Various `S4` functions implement three probability distributions: `BM_bernoulli` for binary data, `BM_poisson` for discrete/count weights, `BM_gaussian` for continuous weights. It allows for SBMs and LBM with or without node covariates and supports multiplex binary networks via `BM_bernoulli_multiplex`.

- `r pkg("sbm")` is an extension of `blockmodels` bi- and multi-partite as well as multiplex networks as proposed by Barbillon et al ([2017](https://www.doi.org/10.1111/rssa.12193)) through dedicated `R6` clasess. It includes functions to plot the resulting partition.

- `r pkg ("greed")` leverages a combination of greedy local search and a genetic algorithm to execute (degree-corrected) SBM and Latent Blockmodeling (LBM). 

- `r pkg("dynsbm")` implements the model for temporal networks presented in Matias and Miele ([2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12200)) which combines a static SBM with independent Markov chains for the dynamic part. It supports binary and weighted networks with both discrete or continuous edges. Includes also functions for plotting (`adjacency.plot`, `alluvial.plot`, `connectivity.plot`) the partition and automatically constructs matrices as an array of the right format.

- `r pkg("MLVSBM")` Implements the SBM of multilevel networks where the different matrices each represent an interaction layer either weighter or binary. It generalises the approach proposed by Chabert-Liddell et al. ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2021.107179)) to more than two layers.

- `r pkg("StochBlock")` implements the stochastic blockmodeling of one-mode and linked networks as implemented in Škulj and Žiberna ([2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.003)). It include utilities to plot the results, but cannot choose automatically the 'right' number of clusters and tends to be very slow according to subsequent reviews (see Cugmas and Žiberna [2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.003));

-  `r pkg("GREMLINS")` implements the SBM of generalised multipartite networks where the different matrices each involve nodes that can be partitioned into  a-priori defined _functional groups_ as proposed by Bar-Hen, Barbillon, and  Donnet ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X20963254)).

## Others

- `r pkg("graphclust")` implements an agglomerative algorithm to maximize the integrated classification likelihood criterion and a mixture of stochastic block models based on `igraph` objects.

- `r pkg("idopNetwork")` implments the model proposed by Cao et al ([2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2022.2106103)) to convert static data into their 'dynamic' form contextually inferring informative, dynamic, multi-directional networks with clusterable structures.

- `r pkg("latenetwork")` provides functions to fit and simulate latent position and cluster model using `network` objects and compatibly with `ergm` approaches.
